--- INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ---

1. Start Unity.
  Ideally, make sure you're in a new, clean project
  (ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE UPGRADING THE ASSET).
  To do this, go to "File" -> "New Project".

2. In the top menu, go to "Assets" -> "Import Package" -> "Custom Package".

3. Navigate to and select your purchased *.unitypackage file.
   Unity should start decompressing it automatically.

4. When done uncompressing, Unity will open a dialog titled 'Importing package'.
   Click "All", then "Import".
   When the package has finished importing, a new folder with the asset's name
   should become available in the "Project" view.

6. In the root of this folder you will find an Adobe PDF document containing
   documentation for the asset. Double-click on this asset to get started.

7. IF YOU ARE UPDATING THE ASSET: be sure to carefully read the release notes.

--- UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS ---

1. Upon purchase, you received an email from Opsive Support with the subject line: "Your <asset name> File Download".

2. Locate this email and click the link to download the latest version.

3. It is highly recommended to make a backup of this link for future updates.

That's about it.

Good luck and have fun!
